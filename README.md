# airport-database
A database created for a small airport.

  A small airport has hundreds of flights coming and going each day containing thousands of passengers. They need a database to keep track of incoming and outgoing flights, passenger details, and booking information. If they implement a database, airports can easily see if a flight has been fully booked, the price paid for tickets, details of who will be on the plane, if there are any airline delays, and which airports the planes are coming from and going to. Implementing a database can lead to airports running more efficiently, avoiding the issue of overbooking flights, overcrowding airports, and keeping track of passengers and when they are more likely to book flights.
  
  Knowing flight details including airline name, flight number, and plane capacity can help airports understand travel schedules and organize their operations. Keeping track of passenger information such as birthday, name, and passport information can help airports monitor information related to the people who are traveling, which flights they prefer, and when they are purchasing tickets. By organizing flight scheduling information, such as the date and time of flight departure and arrivals, the origin of flight, and the final destination, airports can better manage traffic.
  
  The airport database is a data set intended for use with SQL on Access Database systems. The database is approximately 2GB in size and consists of 20 tables containing a total of 452 faux records. The airport data files were produced using SQL.
